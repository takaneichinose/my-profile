# My Profile

## Description

This is the main repository of my profile home page.

To see the actual distributed program, please visit my homepage from Github Pages: [https://takaneichinose.github.io](https://takaneichinose.github.io).

This is the repository of the distributed program. [https://github.com/takaneichinose/takaneichinose.github.io](https://github.com/takaneichinose/takaneichinose.github.io)

The main concept of my homepage is like a game. The UI is like retro game with pixellated images. The messagebox is like a speech dialog which is common in retro RPG game.

You can click anywhere on the floor to move the character. Although movement of character is meaningless, I just want to show the animation of the character while moving. The movement has also an algorithm where the character avoids an object with collision on it.

There are few interactable objects in this game.

1. Files -> To view my resume
2. Laptop -> To open my blog
3. Top-right hamburger -> To open the main menu

## Building the program

For my future reference, below is the way in how to build the program.

1. Clone the repository
2. Optional: Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as package manager
3. Install the dependencies using yarn ``` # yarn ``` or using npm ``` # npm install ```
4. Build the main program using yarn ``` # yarn build ``` or using npm ``` # npm run build ```
5. At the step above, the distributed program will be produced, and _dist_ folder will be generated. The step from here will be optional if you want to run the program on the localhost.
6. Create a local virtual server using yarn ``` # yarn start ``` or using npm ``` # npm start ```.
7. After building, usually it can accessed at [http://localhost:1234/](http://localhost:1234/).
